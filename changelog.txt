V0.1.0 (03.06.2023)
- initial version
- works for ATtinyX4 only on the target side
- on the server side, only an Arduino UNO has been tested
- library should work for all supported chips.

V0.2.0 (03.06.2023)
- added check in calibTarget for stopping at the OSCCAL boundaries
- added a check for progress when changing OSCCAL value; if none (probably an XTAL), we stop
- added ATTinyX5, ATtinyX61, and ATtiny1634
- taking always 3 measurements and selecting median (still problems)

V0.3.0 (22.06.23)
- using now stripped down I/O instead of TXOnlySerial (and saved 600
bytes)

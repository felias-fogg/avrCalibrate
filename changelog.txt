V0.1.0 (03.06.2023)
- initial version
- works for ATtinyX4 only on the target side
- on the server side, only an Arduino UNO has been tested
- library should work for all supported chips.

V0.2.0 (03.06.2023)
- added check in calibTarget for stopping at the OSCCAL boundaries
- added a check for progress when changing OSCCAL value; if none (probably an XTAL), we stop
- added ATTinyX5, ATtinyX61, and ATtiny1634
- taking always 3 measurements and selecting median (still problems)

V0.3.0 (22.06.23)
- using now stripped down I/O instead of TXOnlySerial (and saved 600
bytes)

V0.4.0 
- switch to non-IRQ mode
- corrected intref computation
- minimized everything so that 2KByte MCUs can use the sketch (when
  millis are disabled)
- exchanged MOSI and SCK
- use MISO if chip does not have SPI, otherwise MOSI (this is a bit
  confusing) -> this fixed the unreliability problem (guess why)
  
V0.5.0
- check one additional OSCCAL value after crossing the treshold
  because of pseudo-monotonicity
- changed FRQPIN in calibTarget to INPUT_PULLUP and set PUSHPULL in
  calibServer to false, i.e. , it is now open collector
- use now MOSI and MISO, since SCK is used for the LED_BUILTIN on the
  UNO
- changed to 10 Hz
- tweaked outputs so that it can run on 2K MCUs (less wordy, though),
  and one needs to disable the millis interrupt

V0.5.1
- adapted documentation
